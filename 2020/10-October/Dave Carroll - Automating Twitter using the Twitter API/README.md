### Summary:
Twitter is a powerful tool for sharing your message with the world. Most people send and read their tweets wither through the Twitter website or an app on their phone. However, it is possible to automate your twitter experience by using the Twitter API!

Dave Carroll is a DevOps engineer who blogs regularly about how to use PowerShell to get your job done easier. Over the last 20+ years, he has focused on automation with half of that time spent honing his PowerShell skills, from the first command to his open source modules.

Dave has created a Twitter module for PowerShell that allows him to automate his tweets from his cmd prompt. Join Dave for a look at how he figured out how to use the Twitter API, handle the authentication requirements and deal with errors while tweeting. We'll wrap this all up with some live tweeting!
