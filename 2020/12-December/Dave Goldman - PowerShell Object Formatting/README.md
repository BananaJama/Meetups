David is going to be talking about how to massage your PowerShell output data to work better for you. He will discuss how PowerShell formats output objects it creates, how formatting is determined and how you can create your own custom formatting views.

The PowerShell object model is one of the things that makes PowerShell such a powerful tool. The ability to get data and maniuplate is something all users of PowerShell learn to master of time. This presentattion will reinforce core concepts like what a PowerShell object is, How objects are passed down the pipeline from start to finish, and how PowerShell generates views for objects it creates (Table, List, Wide, Custom objects).

There is a ton of information David plans to cover so buckle up and get ready a deep dive into PowerShell object formatting!
