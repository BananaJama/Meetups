#### Notes

There are no slides for this presentation. The presentation is focused on demos.

1. Who am I and how did I get started?

   I am the Lead writer for PowerShell documentation at Microsoft. I have worked at Microsoft for 22
   years. Most of that time was spent in Product Support for Windows. Lots of experience with
   scripting, network protocol analysis, crash dump analysis, and teaching classes for all of those
   topics.

   For how I got started, see https://seanonit.wordpress.com/about.
