### Summary

Think you’re good with code? Join us for a fun night of scripting challenges that range from simple to challenging! Our guest speaker for the evening is the author and creator of the “Month of Lunches” series of PowerShell learning books, Jeff Hicks!

We asked Jeff to come up with some challenges to help our members learn fresh ways to do some common script tasks. Jeff is a master at finding interesting ways to challenge individuals on how to use PowerShell code to its fullest potential.

Jeff has designed eight separate challenges for attendees to solve. We’ll be doing these puzzles together, interactively and sharing the results. The goal here is to help people learn alternative ways to do common tasks and highlight the fact that there are multiple solutions to solve a riddle.

Now before you wonder if you need to be scripting pro to take part; stop right there! This meeting is for ALL levels of scripters and its purpose to help EVERYONE learn something useful. Come join us and see if you can solve all eight challenges!
