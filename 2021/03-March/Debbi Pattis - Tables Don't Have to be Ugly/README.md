### Summary

Producing reports is a regular task for most IT professionals. We're excellent at producing the data we need via automation, but for some reason we're all kind of terrible at making those reports look nice. Debbie Pattis is here to help solve that problem!

This meeting we welcome Debbie Pattis for a demonstration on how we can make our reports, charts, tables and graphs look better through the use of HTML and CSS. For many IT pros, CSS is a nasty word, But Debbie is here to show us some CSS basics and how those basics can be used to quickly produce stylized code that makes an impact.

Debbie is a webmaster and spends her day knee-deep in HTML, CSS and WordPress. She will be joined by RTPSUG leader Jeremy Brown, who will take her CSS tips and turn it into some PowerShell magic. Join us a for a primer on HTML, CSS and how to turn that into useable code to make your reports and tables look fantastic!
